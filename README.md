Overview of the Project

Project: TEMPERATURE CONVERTER

Objective

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly temperature conversion tool that allows users to input a temperature in one scale (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin) and convert it to another scale. This project aims to practice basic C++ concepts, particularly user input/output, control structures, and modular design with functions.

Key Activities

User Interaction:

1. Input Collection: Prompt the user to select the input temperature scale, enter the temperature value, and select the output scale for conversion.

2. Temperature Conversion:

Conversion Functions: Create individual functions for each possible temperature conversion (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit to Kelvin, etc.).

Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++


Key Insights

1. Modular Code Design
2. Error Handling for Robust User Experience
3. Scalability and Extendability
